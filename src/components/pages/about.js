          Developing clean, elegant, code to solve complex real-world problems
          is what I live for. I love to tackle new challenges that push me to
          learn something new, even if it is just to refactor a piece of old
          code. I have experience working in both front-end and back-end
          development. Iâ€™m currently looking for a company that has a product I
          can get excited about, as well as contribute to my growth.
